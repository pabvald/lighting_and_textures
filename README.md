# Phong reflection model & Textures with WebGL
A interactive 3D visualization implemented with WebGL, which allows to understand how the Phong Model works.

## Lighting

Both the light position (x,y,z)  and the intensity of the three light components (ambiental, diffuse, specular) can be modified with sliders.
