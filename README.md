# Phong reflection model & Textures with WebGL
A interactive 3D visualization implemented with WebGL, which allows to understand how the Phong Model works.

## Lighting

Both the light position (x,y,z)  and the intensity of the three light components (ambiental, diffuse, specular) can be modified with sliders.

* [Phong reflection model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model)

## Textures
Different materials will reflect the light in a different way.One material can be choosen among the following three:

* Steel
![Steel](steel.png =128px)

* Wood
![Wood](wood.png =128x128)

* Brick
![Brick](bricks.png =128x128)
